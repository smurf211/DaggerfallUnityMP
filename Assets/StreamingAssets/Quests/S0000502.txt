<ce>            Here's a little something I've been working on.
<ce>                    See how you like it.  I'm off!

%qdt:
 _rebel_, the rebel mage
 who was once my quarry, has
 asked me to meet his messenger
 in _tavern_ in __tavern_.

Message:  1021
%qdt:
 An atronach sent by _rebel_
 informed me that he would like me
 to help him explore Direnni Tower
 on the Isle of Balfiera.
 _rebel_ will meet me there,
 somewhere.

Message:  1030
%pcn:  Greetings!
 
 I hope this note finds you well.
 Are you interested in a little
 adventure?  If so, meet my messenger
 at _tavern_ in __tavern_
 in ____tavern_.
 
<ce>                 Your partner in Unsanctioned Magery,
<ce>                                    
<ce>                                _rebel_

Message:  1031
<ce>                 A faint scent of brimstone greets you
<ce>                     as you walk through the door.
<ce>                    Is that an atronach over there?
<ce>                       With a note pinned to its
<ce>                        back saying, "HIT ME"?

Message:  1032
<ce>                     The atronach intones stonily:
<ce>                                    
<ce>                    "Hello %pcn.  I am =atronach_,
<ce>                      humble servant of _rebel_.
<ce>                 He asks if you would like to explore
<ce>                 Direnni Tower on the Isle of Balfiera
<ce>                  with him.  A magical place full of
<ce>                 wonders beyond imagining.  My master
<ce>               will meet you there in =towertime_ days."
<ce>                                    
<ce>                   With that, =atronach_ disappears
<ce>                          in a puff of smoke.

Message:  1040
<ce>                     %pcf, good to see you again!
<ce>                   You seem to have started with out
<ce>                   me -- that chest you're carrying
<ce>                  is exactly the thing I was looking
<ce>                   for.  You don't mind if I borrow
<ce>                     it, do you?  Thanks so much!

Message:  1041
<ce>                   %pcf, I'm glad you could join my
<ce>                  little party.  Listen, I'm looking
<ce>                   for one specific thing, a _item_
<ce>                  which I believe is somewhere within
<ce>                 Direnni Tower.  You can keep anything
<ce>                 else we find, all I want is that box.
<ce>               Well then, let's be on our way, shall we?

Message:  1042
<ce>               Ah, this is the _item_ I was looking for.
<ce>              Hmm, I was expecting there to be some kind
<ce>                        of guardian... uh oh...

Message:  1043
<ce>                       Well then, it's been fun.
<ce>                        Perhaps we can do this
<ce>                        again sometime.  Ta ta!

Message:  1050
<ce>                       Take that! and that! you
<ce>                           moldy old thing!

Message:  1051
<ce>                        That's the spirit!  How
<ce>                     about a little of this, too!

Message:  1052
<ce>                      Bloody hell, let's get out
<ce>                        of here!  If I can just
<ce>                       get this spell to work...

Message:  1070
<ce>                A raven circles overhead, then alights
<ce>                 on your shoulder.  Most unusually, it
<ce>               is carrying an engraved card in its beak.
<ce>              It fixes you with one beady eye, tucks the
<ce>                 card into your shirt, and flaps away.
